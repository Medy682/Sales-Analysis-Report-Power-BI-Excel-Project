# Business Insight Highlight
Although **Phones** is the highest-selling subcategory overall, the top individual product is a **high-value copier (Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier)**.  
This highlights the difference between:
- **High-volume product groups** (e.g. Phones), and
- **High-ticket individual items** (e.g. Copiers)

This distinction is important for understanding revenue drivers and informing pricing, inventory, and sales strategies.
